# SCVC HDR Brachytherapy Filter (STL Model)

This repository contains the **3D CAD model (.stl)** of a custom copper filter
designed to improve **dose uniformity** in single-channel vaginal cylinder (SCVC)
high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy.

The filter geometry was developed using Monte Carlo simulations
(TOPAS/Geant4) and AutoCAD, and is intended as a **research prototype** for
investigators exploring novel SCVC designs.
